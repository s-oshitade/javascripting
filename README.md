This repo contains my response to 20 preliminary challenges that I solved as the first task in the preparatory course for the Web Development Bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs. These preliminary callenges were introduced before the instructional modules. Applicants are expected to complete the prep course before starting bootcamp. Excited to dive in from here on out!
